The title of our paper is "*Corking by Forking: Vulnerability Analysis of Blockchain*". I am the corresponding author of this paper.

In general, we analyze the vulnerability incurred by intentional forks of the blockchain network (e.g., Bitcoin) through large deviation theory, which provides us basis for countermesure design in a cost-efficient and timely manner.
