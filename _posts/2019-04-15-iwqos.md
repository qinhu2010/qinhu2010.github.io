Our paper named "A Game Theoretic Analysis on Block Withholding Attacks Using the Zero-Determinant Strategy" has been accepted by IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service 2019, which will be held on June 24-25, 2019 in Phoenix, AZ. This paper takes advantage of zero-determinant game theory to theoreticaly analyze a typical mining related attack in blockchain, i.e., block withholding attack, where some malicious miners will intentionally withhold their mined blocks so as to decrease the payoff of the current pool. With the help of game theory, we mainly consider the attacks between two competitive pools in blockchain where each can choose to attack each other or not, which is modeled as a two-player simultaneous game and analyzed with zero-determinant strategy for more interesting results.
